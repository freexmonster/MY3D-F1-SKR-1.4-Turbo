# MY3D-F1-SKR-1.4-Turbo
MY3D F1 + SKR 1.4 Turbo modification 

Display MKS_MINI_12864 (this default MY3D F1 display)

Stepper Drivers MC2209

I was able to adapt the native MKS 3d printer display for the skr1.4 turbo. I had to study the pinout of the display and motherboard. And also I managed to rewrite the marlin firmware from skr 1.4 turbo and MY3D F1. I can post a project on github, add a link to the description of the project.

In 2 days I will make a complete description of the modification.

To be continued.....

## Building Marlin 2.0

Additional documentation can be found at the [Marlin Home Page](http://marlinfw.org/).
Please let us know if Marlin misbehaves in any way. Volunteers are standing by!

To build Marlin 2.0 you'll need [Arduino IDE 1.8.8 or newer](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) or [PlatformIO](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide.html#platformio-ide). Detailed build and install instructions are posted at:

  - [Installing Marlin (Arduino)](http://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_arduino.html)
  - [Installing Marlin (VSCode)](http://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_platformio_vscode.html).
